<p class="has-drop-cap">It felt pretty straight forward to decide who belongs in the top 10 best flute players in the world list. I believe most of us will agree with the choices, but where the discussion really begins is with the order in the rankings, due to the subjectivity involved.</p>



<p>Part of the issue is, to be included the flutist had to be among the most skilled, period. But we also took into consideration their creativity levels, their techniques, and their contributions to keeping this instrument live in the public mind, much like we did in our <a href="https://ledgernote.com/blog/interesting/best-harmonica-players-of-all-time/">Best Harmonica Players of All Time</a> list.</p>



<p>Being stuck with only ten top picks was hard so we added several runners up as well as a list of honorable mentions too, so if you don't see your pick for best flautist, keep looking further down. Let's go ahead and jump into the <em>list of the best flute players in the world...</em></p>



<h2>#10 - Matt Malloy</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large thin"><img loading="lazy" width="600" height="400" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20600%20400'%3E%3C/svg%3E" alt="Matt Malloy is one of the best flute players in the world, known for his work with the Chieftains and the Irish Chamber Orchestra" class="wp-image-20710" data-lazy-src="https://ledgernote.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/matt-molloy.jpeg"/><noscript><img loading="lazy" width="600" height="400" src="https://ledgernote.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/matt-molloy.jpeg" alt="Matt Malloy is one of the best flute players in the world, known for his work with the Chieftains and the Irish Chamber Orchestra" class="wp-image-20710"/></noscript></figure>



<h3>Associated Acts: The Chieftains, Irish Chamber Orchestra, The Bothy Band</h3>



<p>Matt Malloy has had a long and illustrious career, and it started when he was very young. Malloy was born Irish into a community that produces some of the best flutists in the world. At just nineteen years old, he won the All-Ireland Flute Championship, which led him to be thought of as one of the most talented Irish flute players ever.</p>



<p>In the 1970s, he joined the Bothy Band and became the band’s successor, which he took advantage of to re-found Planxty, the Irish folk band known for making Irish folk music popular. Throughout his career, Malloy has worked with quite a few top musicians, including the Irish Chamber Orchestra.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>Trivia Facts:</strong> Not only is Malloy a talented flutist, but he also dabbled in a bit of acting throughout his career. You can view him in a few Irish films such as “An Eviction Notice,” “Celtic Tides,” and “An Irish Evening: Live and the Grand Opera House.” He is also the owner of a Pub in Westport on Bridge Street that features live Irish music.</p></blockquote>



<h2>#9 - Julius Baker</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large thin"><img loading="lazy" width="600" height="400" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20600%20400'%3E%3C/svg%3E" alt="Julius Baker is one of the best flute players of all time, working with some of the top orchestras around the globe." class="wp-image-20711" data-lazy-src="https://ledgernote.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/julius-baker.jpg"/><noscript><img loading="lazy" width="600" height="400" src="https://ledgernote.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/julius-baker.jpg" alt="Julius Baker is one of the best flute players of all time, working with some of the top orchestras around the globe." class="wp-image-20711"/></noscript></figure>



<h3>Associated Acts: Chicago Symphony Orchestra, New York Philharmonic Orchestra</h3>



<p>Julius Baker has been playing the flute since he was nine years old with the help of his Russian immigrant father. He studied under August Caputo and Robert Morris before attending the Eastman School of Music under the wing of Leonardo De Lorenzo.</p>



<p>After finishing school, he scored the position of the second flute in the Cleveland Orchestra, one of the <a href="https://ledgernote.com/blog/interesting/best-orchestras-in-the-world/">best orchestras in the world</a>, and went on to a principal flute tenure in the New York Philharmonic.</p>



<p>Baker was a huge fan of chamber music and helped found the Bach Aria Group. He had a prominent career as a professor at Juilliard, Curtis Institute of Music, and Carnegie Mellon. Baker also produced a handful of flute albums, and many considered his music the most beautiful they’d ever heard.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>Trivia Facts:</strong> Julius Baker took part in scoring major films such as “The Little Mermaid,” “Beauty and the Beast,” and “Lovesick.” He also loved electronics and considered himself to be an amateur ham radio operator. He enjoyed building audio equipment and taping his solo recordings early in his career.</p></blockquote>



<h2>#8 - Robert Dick</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large thin"><img loading="lazy" width="600" height="400" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20600%20400'%3E%3C/svg%3E" alt="Robert Dick is one of the best flutists in the world, known for making a mark like inventing new parts for the flute instrument." class="wp-image-20712" data-lazy-src="https://ledgernote.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/robert-dick.jpg"/><noscript><img loading="lazy" width="600" height="400" src="https://ledgernote.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/robert-dick.jpg" alt="Robert Dick is one of the best flutists in the world, known for making a mark like inventing new parts for the flute instrument." class="wp-image-20712"/></noscript></figure>



<h3>Associated Acts: Creative Associates, New York Philharmonic Orchestra</h3>



<p>Robert Dick was a prominent flutist, teacher, author, and composer. He is known for being the inventor of the “glissando headjoint,” which is a custom-style flute head that gives flutes the ability to mimic the sounds of an electric guitar-like whammy bar.</p>



<p>Robert began playing the flute in the fourth grade and studied under many prominent musicians, including Julius Baker. After finishing school, Dick moved to Buffalo, New York, to join the Creative Associates. During that time, he wrote a second book and developed himself as a top-tier composer. Dick’s genres include classical, jazz, contemporary jazz, and also “free improvisation,” which explains his glissando headjoint tunes.</p>



<p>Over the years, he continued to grow his career as a soloist, developer, and composer. He typically splits his time between New York and Kassel, Germany performing his own music and spending time with his family.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>Trivia Facts:</strong> He won the Lifetime Achievement Award from the National Flute Association in 2014. His work has been recognized by a Guggenheim Fellowship, NEA Composers Fellowships, and a Koussevitzky Foundation Commission. He has produced more than twenty albums and appeared in many other guest recordings.</p></blockquote>



<h2>#7 - Emmanuel Pahud</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large thin"><img loading="lazy" width="600" height="400" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20600%20400'%3E%3C/svg%3E" alt="Emmanuel Pahud is one of the best flutists of all time.

He focuses on classical and baroque styles." class="wp-image-20713"/></noscript></figure>



<h3>Associated Acts: Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra</h3>



<p>Emmanuel Pahud is a Franco-Swiss flute player. He is known most for his classical and baroque style flute playing. His family was not musical, and he found his love for flute music living in Italy. Pahud studied the flute from age four until 22 under prominent musicians such as Carlos Bruneel and Aurele Niccolet.</p>



<p>In 1992, he joined the Berlin Philharmonic as the youngest flute player ever. He is a self-proclaimed musical chameleon and boasts that he does not represent a particular style; rather, he chooses to adapt to any style he is given. Today, he shares the principal flute position on the Berlin Philharmonic with Mathieu Dufour.</p>



<p>His creativity and flexibility, not to mention his talent and dedication, has made him one of the few and rare young modern players on this list of best flute players in the world.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>Trivia Facts:</strong> The first flute Pahud ever played was a silver-plated Yamaha. He spent a lot of his childhood traveling around the world, which helped him discover the many sounds of the flute and opened up a world of musical greatness.</p></blockquote>



<h2>#6 - Bobbi Humphrey</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large thin"><img loading="lazy" width="600" height="400" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20600%20400'%3E%3C/svg%3E" alt="Bobbi Humphrey plays jazz fusion, soul-jazz, and funk flute.

She's known for her time with Blue Note Records." class="wp-image-20714"/></noscript></figure>



<h3>Associated Acts: Blue Note Records</h3>



<p>Born Barbara Ann, Bobbi Humphrey is a well-known American jazz singer and flutist. She is most known for playing jazz fusion, soul-jazz, and funk. After high school, Humphrey studied at Texas Southern University and Southern Methodist University.</p>



<p>After college, she moved to New York and began her career almost immediately. She signed under George Butler with the Blue Note. She recorded with many prominent artists throughout her musical career, which helped grow her audience and reputation. One of the most notable was <em>Blacks and Blues </em>with the Mizell Brothers.</p>



<p>However, Bobbi did not see much financial success from her Blue Note albums, so in 1977 she shifted her focus to the business end of the music industry. Through this, she created the Bobbi Humphrey Music Company and even signed an agreement with Warner Bros.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>Trivia Facts:</strong> She was the first female flutist to be signed by Blue Note. While at Southern Methodist, she was approached by Dizzy Gillespie, who advised her to move to New York to become a musician. Throughout her career, Humphrey has played with Duke Ellington and George Benson.</p></blockquote>



<h2>#5 - Marcel Moyse</h2>
